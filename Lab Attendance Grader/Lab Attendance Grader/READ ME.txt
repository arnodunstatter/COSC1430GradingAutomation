In order to use this:
1. Make sure you have the roster.txt in the appropriate place.
2. Download the attendance files from teams. Save as "attendance" with ANSI encoding. The default UTF encoding will give weird symbols instead of plain text.
3. Enter the start times for lab and the reconvene times and the amount of lee-way you're giving the students for joining late.
